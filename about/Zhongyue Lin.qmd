## Education/Work Background

I embarked on academic journey with a dual degree in Finance and Business Management from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. To elevate my understanding of human cognition and decision-making processes, I pursued a Master's degree in Behavioral and Economic Sciences at the University of Warwick in the UK. This rigorous academic training deepened my insights into the inherent biases within these processes and significantly broadened my knowledge base.

Despite lacking full-time work experience, I capitalized on a variety of internships and practical engagements during the gap year between my undergraduate and master's studies to teach myself data analysis and programming. I served as a student assistant in the Language Lab at the University of Nebraska Omaha, assisting with academic tasks and research. Additionally, I was a Data Science Teaching Assistant at an online seminar on organizational behavior hosted by the University of Southern California, which honed my pedagogical skills in data science. I also interned as a Behavioral Science Consulting Assistant at Cowry Consulting in UK, and as a Social Media Data Analyst at MININGLAMP Technology in Shanghai, China. In my role at Essence Securities in Shenzhen, China, I contributed as a Quantitative Financial Analyst, applying my skills in the dynamic financial sector. These experiences have not only sharpened my programming abilities but have also fostered a nuanced understanding of data science and behavioral science, thereby laying a solid foundation for my future research endeavors.

## R experience

I have taught myself R through Coursera and Udemy during my internship. Then I studied R for my first Masters at Warwick University, where I applied R to experimental analysis in behavioral science, psychology and cognitive science, but these experiences were entirely task-oriented and I did not learn R systematically.

## Research interests

My research interest is to extend behavioral science from the micro level of the individual to the macro level of society. The human decision making process is influenced by the social environment, but if the decisions of a group of decision makers will in turn influence society? I find the relationship between the two interesting, and I hope that my studies in the DACSS program will help me to construct a connection between the two. And I hope to have the opportunity to apply my knowledge to research in the field of gerontology in the future.

## Hobbies

-   Watching movies (I've recently revisited Blade Runner and Blade Runner 2049!)

-   Fitness

-   Cooking

-   Coding I find coding to be a great means of practice logical abilities :)

-   Listening to classical music (I am particularly fond of Ryuichi Sakamoto and Shostakovich)

## Fun fact

-   This is my first attempt at completing a degree through online education, which is a new challenge for me compared to traditional education methods (especially balancing work and course time)

-   I really like fish and chips :)

-   I was a student of film history before entering my undergraduate degree at UNO and I have seen 3000 films.
