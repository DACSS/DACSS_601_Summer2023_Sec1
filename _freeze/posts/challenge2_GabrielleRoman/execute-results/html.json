More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nThe data contains 2,930 rows and 3 columns. The data is a count of number of employees in different counties and their respective states. \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError: <text>:1:5: unexpected symbol\n1: The data\n        ^\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad_data%>%\n  group_by(state)%>%\n  summarise('average total employees' = mean(total_employees))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in UseMethod(\"group_by\"): no applicable method for 'group_by' applied to an object of class \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\n# I'm having an issue with my code where any use of the group_by, summarise, or related dplyr functions leads to R insisting my variable has a class of \"character\" and can't be analyzed with that function. My intent was to group by unique state (with no repetitions) the average number of employees. It would be a total employees mean of all rows with the same state initials.\n",
