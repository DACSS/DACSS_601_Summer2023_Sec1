More challenging data may require additional code chunks and documentation.\n\n## Describe the data\n\nUsing a combination of words and results of R commands, can you provide a high level description of the data? Describe as efficiently as possible where/how the data was (likely) gathered, indicate the cases and variables (both the interpretation and any details you deem useful to the reader to fully understand your chosen data).\n\nThe data contains 2,930 rows and 3 columns. The data is a count of number of employees in different counties and their respective states. \n\n\n## Provide Grouped Summary Statistics\n\nConduct some exploratory data analysis, using dplyr commands such as `group_by()`, `select()`, `filter()`, and `summarise()`. Find the central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, mix/max/quantile) for different subgroups within the data set.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nrailroad_data%>%\n  group_by(state)%>%\n  summarise('average total employees' = mean(total_employees))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 53 × 2\n   state `average total employees`\n   <chr>                     <dbl>\n 1 AE                          2  \n 2 AK                         17.2\n 3 AL                         63.5\n 4 AP                          1  \n 5 AR                         53.8\n 6 AZ                        210. \n 7 CA                        239. \n 8 CO                         64.0\n 9 CT                        324  \n10 DC                        279  \n# ℹ 43 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Explain and Interpret\n\nBe sure to explain why you choose a specific group. Comment on the interpretation of any interesting differences between groups that you uncover. This section can be integrated with the exploratory data analysis, just be sure it is included.\n\n# I grouped by state in order to collect an average number of employees per state. The result returned 53 rows, indicating that some territories are not states but districts, etc.\n",
