Not all dates between these two points are accounted for, and there are multiple entries for every year. It appears that no federal data was collected for multiple of the observed dates, and there are 3196 NA signifiers (checked using \"sum(is.na(fed_rate))\") in the dataset as a result.\n\n## Tidy Data (as needed)\n\nI have trouble quantifying what \"needs\" to be changed in order to meet tidy requirements, but I think this dataset's year, month, and day columns could be consolidated into one, so I'll do that below.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfed_rate$Date<-as.Date(with(fed_rate, paste(Year,Month,Day,sep=\"-\")),\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in with(fed_rate, paste(Year, Month, Day, sep = \"-\")): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfed_rate<-fed_rate[-c(1:3)]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nview(fed_rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in view(fed_rate): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nAre there any variables that require mutation to be usable in your analysis stream? For example, do you need to calculate new values in order to graph them? Can string values be represented numerically? Do you need to turn any variables into factors and reorder for ease of graphics and visualization?\n\nDocument your work here.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfed_rate<-fed_rate%>%\n  pivot_longer(cols=-Date,\n               names_to = \"variable\",\n               values_to = \"value\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in pivot_longer(., cols = -Date, names_to = \"variable\", values_to = \"value\"): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(fed_rate)[2] =\"Variable\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in colnames(fed_rate)[2] = \"Variable\": object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncolnames(fed_rate)[3] =\"Value\"\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in colnames(fed_rate)[3] = \"Value\": object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nglimpse(fed_rate)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in glimpse(fed_rate): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfed_rate\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in eval(expr, envir, enclos): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Time Dependent Visualization\nThe following is the federal rates displayed over time.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfed_rate%>%\n  filter(str_detect(Variable, \"Federal\"))%>%\n  ggplot(., aes(x = Date, y = Value, color = Variable)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent(scale = 0.5))+\n  labs(title = \"Federal Reserve Rates\", x = \"Date\", y = \"Rate\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in filter(., str_detect(Variable, \"Federal\")): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Visualizing Part-Whole Relationships\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(fed_rate, aes(x = Date, y = Value, fill = Variable))+\ngeom_area()+\nlabs(title = \"Federal Reserve Rates\", x = \"Year\", y = \"Rate\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n```\nError in ggplot(fed_rate, aes(x = Date, y = Value, fill = Variable)): object 'fed_rate' not found\n```\n:::\n:::",
