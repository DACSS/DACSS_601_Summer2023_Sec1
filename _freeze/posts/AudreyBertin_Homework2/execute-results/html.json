For example, Formula 2 has different rules about car design and racing than Formula 1.\n\nAn F1 season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix (GP), which take place around the world on purpose-built racing circuits as well as public roads (termed \"street circuits\"). The number and location of races per season has varied significantly across the years.\n\nThere are currently 10 teams in Formula 1, officially termed \"Constructors\". Like the races, the number of teams (and names) has varied significantly over time. Each team has *two* drivers who race for them each season (as well as a driver on standby in case one of the primary drivers get sick/injured). \n\nEach Constructor is responsible for designing their own car each season within a shared set of regulations that restrict the design across all teams (e.g. a minimum weight, certain aerodynamic requirements, etc.). Some Constructors are known as \"works teams\". These teams design and construct the engines for their cars *in addition* to the aerodynamic components. The rest of the teams are called \"customer teams\". They design the aerodynamic parts of their car, but *purchase* their engines from one of the works teams instead of designing it themselves. For example, currently, the Mercedes *works* team uses their engines for their own car and  *also* provides engines to the Williams and McLaren teams. \n\nThere is also the concept of \"junior teams\", where one company essentially has ownership over multiple teams in F1. They have one primary, A-team, and then a B-team that they can use to develop talent for their A-team. For example, currently Red Bull owns both the Red Bull Racing *and* Alpha Tauri teams, and regularly promote their drivers from Alpha Tauri to Red Bull Racing. For the purposes of the championship, however, these are considered *separate* constructors.\n\nBecause each Constructor designs their own car, cars can vary quite dramatically across teams, so there tends to be a somewhat clear hierarchy. The \"worst\" car often has nearly zero chance of winning a race, and the \"best\" cars almost always end up on the podium. In formula 1 lingo, teams are broken into three categories:\n\n- \"top\" teams -- these teams win most of the races / usually make up the podium\n- \"midfield\" teams -- these teams are not as fast as the top teams but often still place reasonably well and can, on occasion, end up on the podium or even (in rare cases) win a race\n- \"backmarker\" teams -- these teams are significantly slower than the others, with *almost no* chance of ending up on the podium, and usually finish near the back of the pack\n\nDue to this team hierarchy, it can be difficult to compare a driver from one team to a driver on another. Just because one driver always has faster lap times or finishes in a better position does not mean that they are necessarily a better driver, and could just mean that they have a better car. Since both teammates on a given team drive the same car, driver skill is often judged more-so based on how well a driver does compared to their teammates. \n\nIn each season, there are two separate championships up for grabs -- a **Drivers Championship** and a **Constructors Championship**. The Drivers Championship is considered more prestigious and awards the individual driver who received the most points throughout the season. The Constructors Championship is awarded to the *team* with the most *combined* points across their two drivers. \n\nTeams and drivers have the chance to earn points at each Grand Prix (note that there are also points available in what are called \"Sprint races\", but these are a new feature in F1 and we'll be excluding them for the purposes of this analysis in order to simplify things).\n\nEach GP occurs over one weekend is broken up into two segments: qualifying (typically on Saturday) and the race (typically on Sunday). In qualifying, drivers try to put together the *fastest* lap. Lap times then determine the order that the cars will start for the race.\n\nWithin the race, cars are required to make *at least one* pit stop to change which type of tires they are using (there are hard, medium, and soft tires available for each race, each of which have different pros and cons). Depending on how much a given track damages the tires, along with other factors such as if a car is involved in a collision, additional pitstops may take place to change tires or swap out parts.\n\nAt the end of the race, points are awarded based on drivers' finishing position. Additionally, the driver who records the fastest single lap throughout the race is awarded an extra point in addition to their points for finishing position. \n\nThe current points distribution is as follows:\n\n- 1st place: 25 pts\n- 2nd place: 18 pts\n- 3rd place: 15 pts\n- 4th place: 12 pts\n- 5th place: 10 pts\n- 6th place: 8 pts\n- 7th place: 6 pts\n- 8th place: 4 pts\n- 9th place: 2 pts\n- 10th place: 1 pt\n- Fastest Lap: 1 pt \n- 11th-20th place: 0 pts\n\nPoints are cumulative across a season, and the championships are awarded to the team and driver with the highest point totals.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThe dataset I'll be using is hosted on Kaggle at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020\n\nIt contains F1 race data from the series' start in 1950 to the present season, which is currently in-progress and will run until November.\n\nThere are 14 separate files within this dataset:\n\n- `circuits.csv` contains information about the different tracks the drivers race on (a row here is a track)\n- `constructor_standings.csv` contains information about how many points each team was awarded at each race (a row here is a single team at a single race)\n- `constructors.csv` stores the names and nationalities of teams (a row here is a team)\n- `driver_standings.csv` stores information about how many points each driver was awarded at each race (a row here is a single driver at a single race)\n- `drivers.csv` stores the names and nationalities of drivers (a row here is a driver)\n- `lap_times.csv` stores the lap times for every driver on every lap of each race (a row here is a single lap for a single driver at a single race)\n- `pit_stops.csv` stores information about every pit stop taken during each race (a row here is a single pit stop taken by a single driver at a single race)\n- `qualifying.csv` stores qualifying lap times for each driver from each GP (a row here is a single driver in a single GP, and each row contains all qualifying lap times across multiple sessions)\n- `races.csv` contains information about each GP, e.g. track name, date, etc. (a row here is a single GP)\n- `results.csv` contains all of the finishing results for each race, e.g. driver finishing positions, # laps completed, fastest lap (a row here is a single driver at a single race)\n- `seasons.csv` contains the years and urls for wikipedia pages associated with each season (a row here is a season)\n- `sprint_results.csv` same as results.csv but for sprint races, which we'll be excluding (a row here is a single sprint race)\n- `status.csv` contains the encodings of a `status` variable that is referenced in the results files (a row here is a status)\n\n\n",
