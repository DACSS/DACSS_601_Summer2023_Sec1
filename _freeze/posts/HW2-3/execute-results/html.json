Here, I mostly just investigated the data and practiced coding for inquiry. After going through this initial exploration, I am curious as to what types of expenditures are most common. In what ways are lobbyists spending money? There are too many completely different recipients/clients to try to class each one by industry, but I would do so if I had the time.\n",
