    "text": "The blog posts here are contributed by students enrolled in DACSS 601, Fundamentals of Data Science. The course provides students with an introduction to R and the tidyverse, scientific publishing, and collaboration through GitHub, building a foundation for future coursework. Students also are introduced to general data management and data wrangling skills, with an emphasis on best practice workflows and tidy data management.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n     \n     \n       Order By\n       Default\n         \n          Date - Oldest\n        \n         \n          Date - Newest\n        \n         \n          Title\n        \n         \n          Author\n        \n     \n  \n    \n      \n      \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\n\n\nTitle\n\n\nAuthor\n\n\n\n\n\n\nundefined\n\n\nChallenge Overview\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJun 5, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Solutions\n\n\nMoira Chiong\n\n\n\n\nJun 5, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 2 - Hotel Bookings\n\n\nLinus Jen\n\n\n\n\nJun 2, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\nNoah Dixon\n\n\n\n\nJun 2, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Solution\n\n\nShuqi Hong\n\n\n\n\nJun 1, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Solution\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nJun 1, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Instructions\n\n\nAsritha Reddy Gade\n\n\n\n\nJun 1, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 2 - Investigating Hotel Bookings\n\n\nAudrey Bertin\n\n\n\n\nJun 1, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\nDanny Holt\n\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1: Reading and Understanding Data about Railroad Employees Across States & Counties\n\n\nHunter Major\n\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\nJocelyn Lutes\n\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Submission\n\n\nSuyash Bhagwat\n\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1\n\n\nZhongyue Lin\n\n\n\n\nMay 31, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Submission\n\n\nMatt Zambetti\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 4 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Solutions\n\n\nLakshmi Deepthi Kurugundla\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 3 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 8 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 10 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 9 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 - Reading and understanding bird data\n\n\nAudrey Bertin\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nData Import\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 10 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 7 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 2 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 5 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 9 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 1 Solution - Railroad Employment\n\n\nLinus Jen\n\n\n\n\nMay 30, 2023\n\n\nChallenge 6 Instructions\n\n\nSean Conway\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "My academic journey began with a dual degree in Finance and Business Management from the University of Nebraska Omaha. To further my understanding of human cognition and decision-making, I pursued a Master’s degree in Behavioral and Economic Sciences at the University of Warwick in the UK. This experience expanded my knowledge and offered deeper insights into inherent biases within these processes.\nDespite not having full-time work experience, I made the most of various internships and practical engagements during the gap year between my undergraduate and master’s degrees. This period proved instrumental for self-teaching in data analysis and programming. I served as a student assistant at a language lab and a data science teaching assistant at an online seminar, both experiences honing my research and teaching skills. I also participated in internships across the behavioral science consulting industry in the UK, social media data analysis in China, and as a quantitative financial analyst within the financial sector in China. These diverse experiences have not only honed my programming abilities but also cultivated a comprehensive understanding of data science and behavioral science, forming a robust foundation for my future research."

The human decision making process is influenced by the social environment, but if the decisions of a group of decision makers will in turn influence society? I find the relationship between the two interesting, and I hope that my studies in the DACSS program will help me to construct a connection between the two. And I hope to have the opportunity to apply my knowledge to research in the field of gerontology in the future."

I took COMPSCI 685 (Advanced NLP) this past semester, and would like to continue learning more about NLP as the field grows (though at this point, I don’t know anyone who doesn’t say they’re interested in NLP)."
