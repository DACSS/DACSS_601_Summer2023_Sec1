    "text": "Anticipate the End Result\nThe first step in pivoting the data is to try to come up with a concrete vision of what the end product should look like - that way you will know whether or not your pivoting was successful.\nOne easy way to do this is to think about the dimensions of your current data (tibble, dataframe, or matrix), and then calculate what the dimensions of the pivoted data should be.\nSuppose you have a dataset with \\(n\\) rows and \\(k\\) variables. In our example, 3 of the variables are used to identify a case, so you will be pivoting \\(k-3\\) variables into a longer format where the \\(k-3\\) variable names will move into the names_to variable and the current values in each of those columns will move into the values_to variable. Therefore, we would expect \\(n * (k-3)\\) rows in the pivoted dataframe!\n\nExample: find current and future data dimensions\nLets see if this works with a simple example.\n\n\nCode\ndf&lt;-tibble(country = rep(c(\"Mexico\", \"USA\", \"France\"),2),\n           year = rep(c(1980,1990), 3), \n           trade = rep(c(\"NAFTA\", \"NAFTA\", \"EU\"),2),\n           outgoing = rnorm(6, mean=1000, sd=500),\n           incoming = rlogis(6, location=1000, \n                             scale = 400))\ndf\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  country  year trade outgoing incoming\n  &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Mexico   1980 NAFTA    1712.    1015.\n2 USA      1990 NAFTA    1103.     262.\n3 France   1980 EU        723.     788.\n4 Mexico   1990 NAFTA     936.     928.\n5 USA      1980 NAFTA    1329.    -136.\n6 France   1990 EU       1795.     725.\n\n\nCode\n#existing rows/cases\nnrow(df)\n\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nCode\n#existing columns/cases\nncol(df)\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nCode\n#expected rows/cases\nnrow(df) * (ncol(df)-3)\n\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nCode\n# expected columns \n3 + 2\n\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nOr simple example has \\(n = 6\\) rows and \\(k - 3 = 2\\) variables being pivoted, so we expect a new dataframe to have \\(n * 2 = 12\\) rows x \\(3 + 2 = 5\\) columns.\n\n\nChallenge: Describe the final dimensions\nDocument your work here.\nAny additional comments?"

The data appears to be measuring birds in captivity, rather than wild birds.\nWe have 8 categorical variables and 6 numeric. The numeric variables appear to be discrete in that they can only have whole integer values.\nThe different types of birds we are tracking are as follows. We have the most data on chickens and the least on pigeons and other birds.\n\n\nCode\ntable(birds$Item)\n\n\n\n              Chickens                  Ducks Geese and guinea fowls \n                 13074                   6909                   4136 \n  Pigeons, other birds                Turkeys \n                  1165                   5693 \n\n\nThe different type of measurements we have are:\n\n\nCode\ntable(birds$`Flag Description`)\n\n\n\nAggregate, may include official, semi-official, estimated or calculated data \n                                                                        6488 \n                                                          Data not available \n                                                                        1002 \n                                    FAO data based on imputation methodology \n                                                                        1213 \n                                                                FAO estimate \n                                                                       10007 \n                                                               Official data \n                                                                       10773 \n                                                           Unofficial figure \n                                                                        1494 \n\n\nThere appears to be a strange duplicate variable.

    "text": "Reading in delimited text files\n.csv is a common type of delimited text file. .csv stands for comma-separated value. This means that commas separate cells from one another.\nR has a base read.csv() function. However, it comes with a couple of downsides - namely that it imports data as a dataframe rather than a tibble. So we will be using the function read_csv() from the readr package. In addition to importing data as a tibble, it also does a much better job guessing data types.\nread_csv() is essentially a wrapper function (a function that calls another function) around the more general read_delim() function. Also see read_tsv() for tab-separated values.\n\n?read_delim\n\nLet’s look at the data files available for us to read in:\n\nlist.files(\"_data\")\n\n [1] \"~$poultry_tidy.xlsx\"                                                                             \n [2] \"AB_NYC_2019.csv\"                                                                                 \n [3] \"abc_poll_2021.csv\"                                                                               \n [4] \"ActiveDuty_MaritalStatus.xls\"                                                                    \n [5] \"animal_weight.csv\"                                                                               \n [6] \"australian_marriage_law_postal_survey_2017_-_response_final.xls\"                                 \n [7] \"australian_marriage_tidy.csv\"                                                                    \n [8] \"birds.csv\"                                                                                       \n [9] \"cereal.csv\"                                                                                      \n[10] \"cwc.csv\"                                                                                         \n[11] \"Data_Extract_From_World_Development_Indicators.xlsx\"                                             \n[12] \"Data_Extract_FromWorld Development Indicators.xlsx\"                                              \n[13] \"debt_in_trillions.xlsx\"                                                                          \n[14] \"eggs_tidy.csv\"                                                                                   \n[15] \"FAOSTAT_cattle_dairy.csv\"                                                                        \n[16] \"FAOSTAT_country_groups.csv\"                                                                      \n[17] \"FAOSTAT_egg_chicken.csv\"                                                                         \n[18] \"FAOSTAT_livestock.csv\"                                                                           \n[19] \"FedFundsRate.csv\"                                                                                \n[20] \"FRBNY-SCE-Public-Microdata-Complete-13-16.xlsx\"                                                  \n[21] \"hotel_bookings.csv\"                                                                              \n[22] \"organiceggpoultry.xls\"                                                                           \n[23] \"poultry_tidy.csv\"                                                                                \n[24] \"poultry_tidy.RData\"                                                                              \n[25] \"poultry_tidy.xlsx\"                                                                               \n[26] \"Public_School_Characteristics_2017-18.csv\"                                                       \n[27] \"railroad_2012_clean_county.csv\"                                                                  \n[28] \"sce-labor-chart-data-public.xlsx\"                                                                \n[29] \"snl_actors.csv\"                                                                                  \n[30] \"snl_casts.csv\"                                                                                   \n[31] \"snl_seasons.csv\"                                                                                 \n[32] \"starwars1.RData\"                                                                                 \n[33] \"StateCounty2012.xls\"                                                                             \n[34] \"test_objs.RData\"                                                                                 \n[35] \"Total_cost_for_top_15_pathogens_2018.xlsx\"                                                       \n[36] \"USA Households by Total Money Income, Race, and Hispanic Origin of Householder 1967 to 2019.xlsx\"\n[37] \"wild_bird_data.xlsx\"                                                                             \n\n\nThere’s a lot of data files there, but we are going to import the poultry_tidy.csv file.

It can replace for loops with a more readable (and often faster) simple function call.\nFor example, we can draw n random samples from 10 different distributions using a vector of 10 means.\n\nn &lt;- 100 # sample size\nm &lt;- seq(1,10) # means \nsamps &lt;- map(m,rnorm,n=n) \n\nWe can then use map_dbl to verify that this worked correctly by computing the mean for each sample.\n\nsamps %&gt;%\n  map_dbl(mean)\n\n [1]  0.918026  2.046437  2.997427  4.011996  4.790128  5.974945  7.015693\n [8]  8.206551  9.031059 10.006205\n\n\npurrr is tricky to learn (but beyond useful once you get a handle on it). Therefore, it’s imperative that you complete the purr and map readings before attempting this challenge."

However, it’s been a few years since I last used it regularly and there are lots of features I haven’t learned yet, both old things that I never learned before as well as new features like across()/quarto documents. I am hoping to both get a refresher on what I’ve forgotten as well as learn about some new functions and features I’ve not seen before. I’ve also primarily been doing machine learning the last few years so I’m excited for more experience with data visualization."
