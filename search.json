    "text": "## Education/Work Background\nMy name is Moira Chiong (she, her, hers) and I am an incoming student in the Higher Education PhD program in the Dept. of Educational Policy, Research and Administration (EPRA) here at UMass Amherst. I am really excited for this course as I hope to learn R and empirical methods to analyze educationalÂ data. I currently work at the Massachusetts Dept. of Higher Education as an Assistant Director of Academic and Workforce Analysis, and have worked in numerous MA community colleges as a researcher (mainly in institutional research). In my current role, I concentrate on workforce alignment of academic programs with the labor market. Basically, I do a lot of work on return on investment of higher education, with a specific equity lens. I have worked on Department’s Strategic Plan for Racial Equity and designed quantitative forecasting models which lay the groundwork for student success goals. Previously, I was a student in UMass Amherst’s Higher Education Leadership and Administration (HELA) graduate certificate program, and liked the program so much that I decided to apply for the PhD. Fortunately, I was admitted to the PhD program this past Spring 2023 and will officially begin my PhD studies this Fall.Prior to my career in higher education, I worked in international development which brought me as far a Kigali, Rwanda and Manila, Philippines. As you can imagine, I love to travel and learn about other cultures and traditions. I hold academic degrees from Stanford University (BA Economics, BA International Relations) and the University of Maryland, College Park (MS Agricultural and Resource Economics).\n## R experience\nMATLAB, Lyx), and have taken and completed MOOCs on R.\n## Research interests\nI am really interested in quantifying long term outcomes from higher education, and specifically looking at impacts of higher education on social and economic mobility. I am also interested in measuring student success, with particularly interest in upward transfer.\n## Hometown\nNewton, Massachusetts\n## Hobbies\nI also love to sing (a cappella), cook foreign cuisines and listen to great music.\n## Fun fact\nI grew up in the metro Boston area and have a tradition of UMass in my family (my late father was an Economics professor at UMass Boston, and my mom is a doctoral alumna from UMass Amherst)-- so I am very excited to continue that family history."

My thesis focused on processes of meaning-making around beadwork that was used in colonial East Africa and collected into European ethnographic museums. I conducted fieldwork amongst the Chagga of present-day Tanzania, and archival research in the British Museum.\nAfter graduating I worked as a researcher in the curatorial department of the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art for exhibitions exploring contemporary African feminisms. I left the museum to work as an ethnographer on Mount Everest, Nepal, studying decision-making in extreme environments and ethical reflexivity in situations of mortal risk. I shifted back to the US and spent the next 4 years designing and directing global student programs with experiential and interdisciplinary curricula, partnering with schools and companies including National Geographic and the Smithsonian Institute.\nBetween 2018 and 2021 I worked in Bhutan as an education researcher for an education initiative under the royal secretariat. We developed and began implementation of a holistic public education system that is grounded in Buddhist values and pedagogies. After 3 years in Bhutan I moved to Missoula, Montana, where I currently live. For the past year I have been working for the Tang Institute at Phillips Academy in Andover, overseeing an action research program and the development of an ethics pedagogy for high school computer science courses.\nIn September I’ll be a full-time student on campus, and I hope to meet all of you who are on campus!"
