<p>From inspection, this seems to be a national poll of political identification and beliefs from 2021. 527 people from 49 unique states/territory were polled. A quick scan of the list shows that Alaska and Hawaii are excluded, and the District of Columbia is included – so all samples are within the continental US. Generally, the more populous the state, the more samples taken.</p>
<p>Each row is a unique case of one person’s responses, which cover 14 personal demographic questions covering variables such as gender, marital status, household size and housing status. Then there are 11 political questions which seem to caputure political affiliation, views, and attitudes. The remaining 6 questions catpure information that may be specific to the administration of the poll itself, such as the person’s age bracket, language, and ID number, etc.</p>

<p>These data will be difficult to visualize or analyze by other means because the some values for variables of interest are non-standard For instance, the QPID column - presumably, the respondent’s political identification - contains values that mimic natural language, eg. “A Democrat”.</p>

<span id="cb34-85"><a href="#cb34-85" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>From inspection, this seems to be a national poll of political identification and beliefs from 2021. 527 people from 49 unique states/territory were polled. A quick scan of the list shows that Alaska and Hawaii are excluded, and the District of Columbia is included -- so all samples are within the continental US. Generally,  the more populous the state, the more samples taken. </span>

Then there are 11 political questions which seem to caputure political affiliation, views, and attitudes. The remaining 6 questions catpure information that may be specific to the administration of the poll itself, such as the person's age bracket, language, and ID number, etc.</span>
