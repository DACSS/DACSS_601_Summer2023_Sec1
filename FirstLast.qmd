## Education/Work Background
I have a bachelor's in psychology and currently work as a qualitative researcher in the resource development department at Save the Children US.

## R experience
I used R briefly in a previous DACSS course; Corporate Lobbying and the Global Economy. I have no experience using GitHub, and registered for this course briefly last year before dropping due to work conflicts.

## Research interests
I am interested in corporate regulation, program and policy evaluation, and other types of behavioral/economic research for application to policy. 

## Hometown
I was raised in Easton, Connecticut.

## Hobbies
I enjoy niche perfumery as a hobby and watch a lot of corporate fraud content on YouTube.

## Fun fact
I have never broken a bone.
